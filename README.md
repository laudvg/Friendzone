# :rainbow: Friendzone :rainbow:

### Getting Started :zap:
Friendzone is a full stack aplication made for my bootcamp program in two weeks.
The idea is to make a place where you can find new friends, so, the app does a match with someone based on a easy to do personality test, then 
you can talk with all the people that you had a match with.

### Improvements :paperclip:
I'm not a psichologist is a naive aproach to a personality test, so I think that can be improved.
I would like to upgrade the chat, in a way you can be in a two people chat, create your own group of friends, etc...
I think it would be cleaner if I use Redux :blush:

### Details :pushpin:
:computer: This was made using MongoDB, ExpressJs, React y Node.
